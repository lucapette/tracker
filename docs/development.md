# Development

## Roadmap

`tracker` roadmap is available
[here](https://github.com/lucapette/tracker/projects/1).

`tracker` is a personal little project so the goal of this document is to
explain what I intend to work on on my own to improve the sofware and what I
won't be able to develop without support.

### Current

Everything in this column  is already being worked on.

### Near Term

I planned to work on the cards in this column on my own. Support is more than
welcome!

### Future

The features in this column are not planned yet. Two different reasons:

- I don't use or plan to use those features but I believe they'd improve the
  project.
- I don't know how to do it.
