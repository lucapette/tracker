# tracker

My personal activity tracker. It uses awesome open source technology:

- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
- [Influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb)

Please *note* it only works on mac osx and it's largely untested as I wrote it
for myself.
