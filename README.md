# tracker

My personal activity tracker. It uses awesome open source technology:

- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
- [Influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb)

# Current status of the project

I wrote `tracker` to play around with InfluxDB and Grafana. I open sourced it
so I could write on my blog about the experience.

# Installation guide
